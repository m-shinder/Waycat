# Waycat -- scratch-like editor for programming languages
Waycat is extensible block editor for programming languages.
Current goal is finalizing python3.8 support and then move to python3.10.
Since python3.10 have PEG grammar instead of LL(1),
I'm researching this topic and currently do not provide any updates for Waycat
until I'll be ready to do a python3.10 LanguageAPI for Waycat.
You can still use Waycat, write your issues, etc.

## How to build
the easies way, is using GnomeBuilder, select folder, and click "run"
Or, if you want, you can build directly with meson https://mesonbuild.com/Tutorial.html
```
meson setup /path/to/desired/builddir
cd /path/to/desired/builddir
ninja
```
### depends on:
	. vala (tested with 0.54)
	. gtk4 -- the newest (not the best)
	. sourceview-5
	. python3.8-embed

### Known issues:
. somebody messed up with vapi files
	INFILE: `/usr/share/vala-X.YY/vapi/gtk4.vapi`
	LINE: `public virtual bool get_value (GLib.Value value) throws GLib.Error;`
	SHOULDBE `public virtual bool get_value (ref GLib.Value value) throws GLib.Error;`

### Contributing
I'm writing Waycat on my own.
not thinking about convenience to understand it, or even read.
If you want to contribute here is topics that you may try to improve
. Windows support: I gave up on trying to make Waycat usable on Windows
always facing problems with file opening and GTK theming.
Despite that on windows Waycat need different way to run code
. Code quality: There is always things to improve.
You can find some TODOs and solve them. You can make lines not exceed 80 chars.
You can remove useless comments and write useful. Do what you want!
. JS support: Uhm, idk. I'll probably never make it. Or i will. Will I.. Will You... NVM!
